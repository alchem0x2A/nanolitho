# Directory for preparing figures in MBHL paper (Nat. Commun. 2025, NCOMMS-24-51170)

To reproduce the figures, first install the `mbhl` package distributed at the parent directory according to the README.

The jupyter notebooks are named by the pattern `{figure_name}-{description}.ipynb`. For example, to find codes that generate the CL simulation of Fig. 1 in main text, please check `fig1-CL.ipynb`.

The subfigures will be both displayed in the jupyter notebooks, as well as saved in the `subfigs-{name}/` folders which are generated if not created.
